# Animal Sound Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the prediction of animal sounds from environmental recordings using machine learning. We utilize the Librosa library for audio feature extraction and an environmental sound dataset to train our model. The goal is to accurately identify and classify animal sounds, aiding in biodiversity studies and environmental monitoring.

## Features
- **Audio Feature Extraction:** Utilize Librosa for advanced audio feature extraction, including MFCCs, chroma-stft, spectral contrast, and tonnetz features.
- **Dataset:** Training performed on a curated dataset of environmental sounds, specifically focused on various animal calls.
- **Model Training:** Implementation of a machine learning model capable of classifying animal sounds with high accuracy.
- **Easy-to-use Interface:** Command-line interface for processing new audio files and predicting animal sounds.
